# Use Machine Learning to increase sales (Music Streaming)

In this project we have an online music store. When our users signup, we ask their **age** and **gender**, and based on their profile we recommand various music albums they're likely to buy. 
The goal of our project is 
 + Increase sales using Machine Learning 

### The process of this project
 + Building a model
 + Feeding this model with some sample data based on existing users
 + Model will learn patterns in data
 + Ask model to make predictions

### What we aks from our model and how the model responses
 + We have a new user with this profile; what is the kind of music this user interested in?
 + Model will likely answer "Jazz", "Hip-Hop", "Classic", or etc.
 + Based on this prediction we can suggest music to this user

### Steps of this project
 1. Import Data
 2. Clean the data
 3. Split the data into Training/Test sets
 4. Create a Model
 5. Train the Model
 6. Make prediction
 7. Evaluate and Improve
